### Horace Zhong
> ### Brief Introduction
> Hi! My name is Horace Zhong. I studied Psychology and Economics at Colby College. Currently, I'm interested in exploring **human computer interaction**. I like doing **origami**, and recently found that **cooking** could potentially be a good self-care activity for me. 

#### Something fun about my Summer 2023
1. I became a big fan of bernese mountain dog!!
2. I tried to lessen my screen usage time week by week.
3. My flight to Japan for an academic conference was canceled one day before the travel.
